## Instructions for downloading R and RStudio

Download R from <https://www.r-project.org/>

Download RStudio from <https://posit.co/downloads/>

More instructions: <https://datacarpentry.github.io/r-socialsci/>

## Basics

The simplest usage of R is as a calculator. You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```{r}
3 + 5
```

R can be used to store the results of calculations and many other kinds of objects.

```{r}
foo <- 2
foo
```

You can then use those objects in other operations.

```{r}
foo*8
```

## Scripts

The commands you type in the console will be forgotten when you close the session.

For your code and workflow to be reproducible, type commands in the script editor and save it.

RStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor by using the \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt Ctrl} + \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt Enter} shortcut (on Mac, \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt Cmd} + \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt Return}).

## Functions (I)

Most of the work in R is done through functions. There are many functions already implemented in base R (i.e., we do not need to load a package to use them).

Function \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt c()} concatenates values into a vector.

```{r}
myVec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
myVec
```

Function \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt sum()} returns the sum of all present in its arguments.

```{r}
sum(myVec)
```

## Functions (II)

\footnotesize

How do you know how use a function? How do you know what arguments it will accept?

-   Search the function in the **Help** pane
-   Type `help("[function name]")` in the console
-   Type `?[function name]` in the console
-   Type `example("[function name]")` in the console
-   Google it!

If a function is not working...

```{r}
problematicVec <- c(7, NA, 4, 2, NA)
sum(problematicVec)
```

...check the documentation and troubleshoot.

```{r}
sum(problematicVec, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Functions (III)

\footnotesize

We can also define our own bespoke functions. Here is a simple one:

```{r}
addValues <- function(x,y){x+y}
addValues(3,4)
```

**If the same operations need to be repeated throughout your project, it is much better to use functions than copying and pasting your code.**

Save these in a file called \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt util} or \textcolor{JHAccentRed}{\tt functions} that gets sourced at the top of any script they are used in.

## Functions (IV)

\tiny

Example of a complicated function that will make your life easier if it needs to be called multiple times.

```{r}
fitGLMmodel <- function(df, covariate_metadata) {

  training_data <- df %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(
      year1 = year - 1980,
      year2 = year1*year1
    ) %>%
    select(any_of(c("value_raw", "year", "year1", "year2", "gdp", "sex", "country")))
  
  # GLM regression
  fit <- glm(formula = covariate_metadata$glm_formula,
             data = training_data,
             family = covariate_metadata$glm_family,
             na.action = na.omit)

  # Save information about the fit
  capture.output(anova(fit), file=str_glue("./gen/{covariate_metadata$name}/audit/glm_anova.txt"))
  capture.output(confint(fit), file=str_glue("./gen/{covariate_metadata$name}/audit/glm_confint.txt"))
  capture.output(summary(fit), file=str_glue("./gen/{covariate_metadata$name}/audit/glm_summary.txt"))
  
  # Append fitted data to input frame
  value_glm = as_tibble(predict(fit, newdata=training_data, type="response")) %>% rename(value_glm=value)
  result <- cbind(df, value_glm)
  
  # Plot fit
  ggplot(result %>% filter(!is.na(value_raw)), aes(x = value_raw, y = value_glm)) + geom_point()
  ggsave(str_glue("./gen/{covariate_metadata$name}/audit/glm_fit.png"), width = 14, height = 14)
  
  return(result)
}
```

## Packages

R packages are extensions to the programming language. They contain code, data, and documentation.

Packages can be downloaded from the internet by typing in the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("package_name")
```

Once a package is installed on your computer, you do not need to install it again. However, you need to load it every time you start a new R session.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("package_name")
```

## `Base` vs `tidyverse` vs `data.table` (I)

\small

These packages represent three different paradigms in R programming used primarily for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Choosing between them means deciding which toolset you want to use for your data tasks, based on factors like ease of use, performance, and personal or project requirements.

\centering

\scriptsize

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}

# Create the data frame for the table
comparison_table <- data.frame(
  Feature = c(
    "Ease of Use", "Performance", "Readability", "Flexibility", "Memory Usage",
    "Dependencies", "Community", "Learning Curve", "Strengths", "Weaknesses"
  ),
  Base_R = c(
    "Familiar to R users but can be verbose.",
    "Adequate for small datasets.",
    "Can be less readable for complex tasks.",
    "Built-in functions for most tasks.",
    "Moderate, can struggle with larger datasets.",
    "No external packages required.",
    "Core R support with extensive resources.",
    "Moderate, procedural style.",
    "Versatile, minimal dependencies.",
    "Verbose, less efficient for big data."
  ),
  Tidyverse = c(
    "Intuitive and user-friendly syntax.",
    "Decent for small, medium datasets.",
    "Highly readable and beginner-friendly.",
    "Excellent for tidy data workflows.",
    "Higher due to temporary objects.",
    "Requires multiple packages (e.g., `dplyr`).",
    "Large and active.",
    "Low, declarative and pipeline-based.",
    "Simplifies common workflows, consistent.",
    "Slower with large datasets, higher memory."
  ),
  data_table = c(
    "Concise but steep learning curve.",
    "Extremely fast for large datasets.",
    "Compact but may sacrifice readability.",
    "Great for advanced joins and aggregations.",
    "Optimized for low memory usage.",
    "Requires one package (`data.table`).",
    "Smaller but growing.",
    "High, unique syntax.",
    "High performance, large data handling.",
    "Less intuitive for beginners."
  )
)
# Render the table with kable
knitr::kable(comparison_table, format = "latex", col.names = c("Feature", "Base R", "Tidyverse", "data.table")) %>%
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%  # Bold the first row (header)
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down")
```

## Loops

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

\centering

![](figures/for-vs-while-loop.jpg){width="350px"}

## When to loop? (I)

\scriptsize

1. sequential dependencies

    -   \scriptsize when the current iteration depends on the result of the previous
 
\tiny
\vspace{1em}
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
result[1] <- 3
for(i in 2:10){
  result[i] <- result[i - 1] + i
}
```

\scriptsize

2. modifying external objects, writing files

\tiny
\vspace{1em}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:5) {
    plot(1:10, (1:10)^i, main = paste("Exponent:", i))
    ggsave(paste0("plot_", i, ".png"))
}
```

\scriptsize

3. interfacing with external systems

    -   \scriptsize querying a database, making API calls that don't support parallel or batch processing

## When to loop? (II)

\scriptsize

4. complex logic or conditions

    -   \scriptsize if/else conditions or nested logic for when to execute the action

5. debugging

    -   \scriptsize running the same operation on lots of data and identifying that element that trips up your code

6. performance doesn't matter

    -   \scriptsize simple operation prioritizing readability over speed

## Vectorized operations

\scriptsize

A programming technique that performs multiple operations at once instead of using loops to repeat operations one at a time.

\vspace{1em}

```{r}
x <- c(4, 9, 16)
sqrt(x)
```

\vspace{1em}

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
x + y
```

Alternatively, as a loop...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- c(4, 5, 6)
z <- c()
for(i in 1:length(x)){
  z[i] <- x[i] + y[i]
}
```

## The "apply family" (R) (I)

\scriptsize

A family of functions in base R that perform operations on elements like vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists in a more concise way than writing loops.

`apply` operates over rows or columns of a matrix, returns a vector

\tiny

```{r}
# construct a 5 x 6 matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(1:30, nrow = 5, ncol = 6)

# calculate the sum of each column
apply(my_matrix, 2, sum)
```

\scriptsize

`sapply` operates over a vector or list, returns a vector

\tiny

```{r}
# example list of character vectors
char_list <- list(
  animals = c("cat", "dog", "elephant"),
  fruits = c("apple", "banana"),
  colors = c("red", "blue", "green", "yellow")
)

# calculate the length of each element in the list
sapply(char_list, length)
```


## `lapply`

\scriptsize

`lapply` operates over a vector or list and returns a list. It is extremely useful for working with multiple surveys with a standard format.

\vspace{1em}

\tiny

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# define function to clean individual recode data from DHS surveys
fn_cleanIR <- function(x){
  
  x$weight <- x$v005/1000000
  
  if("v024" %in% names(x)){
    x$region_name <- haven::as_factor(x$v024)
  }else{
    x$region_name <- haven::as_factor(x$v101)
  }
  
  # trim white space
  x$myvcal1 <- as.character(x$vcal_1)
  # recode strings with non-alphanumeric characters as NA
  x$myvcal1 <- ifelse(grepl("[^a-zA-Z0-9[:space:]]", x$myvcal1), NA, x$myvcal1)
  
  return(x)
}

# clean datasets stored in list
l_ir_clean <- lapply(l_ir, fn_cleanIR)
```


## RStudio projects

-   Keep all the files associated with a given project together
    -   Input data, scripts, analytical results, and figures
-   *File* \> *New Project*
    -   *File* \> *New File* \> *R Script*
-   When an R project is opened within RStudio...
    -   A new R session is started
    -   The current working directory is set to the project directory
    -   Previously edited documents are restored
    -   RStudio settings are restored
-   Version control
    -   Projects can be connected to a version control repository on Github

## R Markdown

\footnotesize

R Markdown is a flexible type of document that integrates R code with Markdown (like this presentation). 

It allows you to seamlessly combine executable R code and its output with text, and can be readily converted to formats like PDF, Word, and HTML. Widely used for statistical analysis, reporting, and sharing reproducible research.

The `rmarkdown` package comes pre-installed with RStudio.
